# Fairsharer Student Project

A python project that implements an algorithm that iteratively redistributes the given values within a list, with each iteration transferring a fraction of the highest value to its left and right neighbors.

To get started, simply navigate to the /src folder from your command line and run the program by typing fairsharer.py
